    <h1>RADIOACTIVITY</h1>
    <p>Radioactivity is the release of energy from the decay of the nuclei of certain kinds of atoms and isotopes. <br> Nuclei consist of protons and neutrons bound together in tiny bundles at the center of atoms.
         <br>Radioactive nuclei are nuclei that are unstable and that decay by emitting energetic particles such as photons, electrons, neutrinos, protons, neutrons, or alphas (two protons and two neutrons bound together). 
         Some of these particles are known as ionizing particles.
         <br>These are particles with enough energy to knock electrons off atoms or molecules. <br>The degree of radioactivity depends on the fraction of unstable nuclei and how frequently those nuclei decay.

    <p>The first is an alpha particle. These particles consist of two protons and two neutrons and are the heaviest type of radiation particle. Many of the naturally occurring radioactive materials in the earth, like uranium and thorium, emit alpha particles. An example most people are familiar with is the radon in our homes.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The second kind of radiation is a beta particle. It's an electron that is not attached to an atom. It has a small mass and a negative charge. Tritium, which is produced by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere and exists all around us, emits beta radiation. Carbon-14, used in carbon-dating of fossils and other artifacts, also emits beta particles. Carbon-dating simply makes use of the fact that carbon-14 is radioactive. If you measure the beta particles, it tells you how much carbon-14 is left in the fossil, which allows you to calculate how long ago the organism was alive</p>
    <br>
    <p>The third is a neutron. This is a particle that doesn't have any charge and is present in the nucleus of an atom. Neutrons are commonly seen when uranium atoms split, or fission, in a nuclear reactor. If it wasn't for the neutrons, you wouldn't be able to sustain the nuclear reaction used to generate power.</p>
